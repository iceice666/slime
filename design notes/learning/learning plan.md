## Final Notes

- **Balance theory and practice**: For each concept, try to implement a small example to test your understanding.
- **Set realistic goals**: This is an intensive learning plan. Feel free to adjust the timeline based on your pace.
- **Connect with communities**: Join forums like r/ProgrammingLanguages to discuss concepts and get feedback.
- **Build incrementally**: Start with a minimal language core and add features one by one.
- **Take notes**: Keep a journal of your learning journey, especially insights that connect different concepts.
- **Revisit concepts**: Many of these ideas will make more sense after you've seen them in multiple contexts.

This learning plan is ambitious but structured to build your knowledge progressively. The estimated times are
flexibleâsome sections may take longer based on your learning style and prior experience. Focus on deep understanding
rather than rushing through the material.

Good luck with your programming language design journey!
