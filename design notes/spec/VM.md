# Virtual Machine Design Notes

## Garbage Collection

For data on the stack, use a reference counting scheme with weak references to avoid circular dependencies.
For data on the heap, use the 3-color mark-and-sweep garbage collector (reference: golang)

### Reference for 3-color mark-and-sweep GC

## Runtime

- Lightweight runtime with a focus on performance and low overhead (reference: LuaVM && LuaJIT)
- Standard library should focus on immutable data structures and functional operations
- FFI (Foreign Function Interface) should provide seamless interoperability with existing languages/libraries
- Concurrency model should consider lightweight threads or actors with message passing
